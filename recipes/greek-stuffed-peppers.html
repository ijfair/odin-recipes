            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> These Greek stuffed peppers with orzo are a variation of traditional stuffed peppers but using orzo in place of rice, ground beef, Greek seasoning, mint, and lemon juice for a bright, savory flavor.</p>
            <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1/2 cup orzo </li>
                <li> 60 grams fresh spinach </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoons vegetable oil </li>
                <li> 1 small onion, minced </li>
                <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
                <li> 230 grams ground beef </li>
                <li> 1 cup tomato sauce </li>
                <li> 1 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste </li>
                <li> 3 Bell peppers </li>
                <li> 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese, or as needed </li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons pine nuts, or as needed </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Steps </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish. </li>
                <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add orzo and cook for exactly 6 minutes. Place spinach in a strainer. Pour orzo into the strainer over spinach.  </li>
                <li> Transfer orzo and spinach to a mixing bowl and stir in Greek seasoning; set aside. </li>
                <li> Meanwhile, add oil to a heavy skillet, and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, garlic, and ground beef. Cook and stir ground beef until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup tomato sauce. </li>
                <li>Add beef mixture to orzo mixture; add lemon juice and mint, and stir to combine. Taste; adjust lemon juice and mint to taste. </li>
                <li> Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise; carefully remove stem, seeds, and ribs. Stuff peppers with beef orzo mixture. Spread remaining 1/2 cup tomato sauce in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Place each stuffed pepper into the dish; cover with foil. </li>
                <li> Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove foil. Sprinkle pine nuts and feta cheese over peppers. </li>
                <li> Bake until pine nuts are lightly toasted, about 10 minutes more. Serve immediately. </li>
            </ol>
