                <h3> Steps </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Stir chicken, green enchilada sauce, and 1 cup cheese together in a bowl. Reserve 2 tablespoons green onions for topping. Add remaining green onions to chicken mixture, and set aside.</li>
                    <li> Drizzle oil in the bottom of a deep 9x13-inch baking dish. Add half the chips to the dish and top evenly with beans and 1 cup cheese. Pour 3/4 cup red enchilada sauce over the top.   </li>
                    <li> Spread chicken mixture evenly over the sauce and top with remaining chips. Pour remaining red enchilada sauce evenly over the casserole; top with remaining cheese. Cover with foil. </li>
                    <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; uncover, and cook until browned and bubbly, about 10 minutes longer. </li>
                    <li> Serve topped with desired toppings. </li>
